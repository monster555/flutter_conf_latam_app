# Conf Cloud Functions Data Source

The `conf_cloud_functions_data_source` package provides data access and integration with backend services via Cloud Functions for the FlutterConf LATAM project. It handles communication with serverless APIs, manages data retrieval and submission, and abstracts network logic from the rest of the app.

This package is intended for internal use within the FlutterConf LATAM project.
