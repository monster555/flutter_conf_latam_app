# Conf Data Source

The `conf_data_source` package defines abstract data sources and repository interfaces for the FlutterConf LATAM project. It establishes contracts for data access and management, enabling a clean separation between data handling and business logic.

This package is intended for internal use within the FlutterConf LATAM project.
